You are using the default value for `max_pairs`, which may be too small and thus lead to inaccurate estimates for your model's u-parameters. Consider increasing to 1e8 or 1e9, which will result in more accurate estimates, but with a longer run time.
----- Estimating u probabilities using random sampling -----
u probability not trained for name - Exact match (comparison vector value: 2). This usually means the comparison level was never observed in the training data.
u probability not trained for name - Levenshtein <= 2 (comparison vector value: 1). This usually means the comparison level was never observed in the training data.

Estimated u probabilities using random sampling

Your model is fully trained. All comparisons have at least one estimate for their m and u values
