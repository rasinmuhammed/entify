Hook Brainstorm (3 options):

"If you’re a Muslim, let me ask you something…"

"There’s one question Muslims rarely say out loud, but we all think it."

"Have you ever asked yourself if your choices even matter if Allah already knows everything?"

Chosen Hook: Option 1 (strong emotional pull, starts conversationally)

[00:00-00:03]
Visual: Close-up UGC selfie shot, neutral tone, soft lighting. Text overlay: “If you’re a Muslim, let me ask you something.”
Voiceover: "If you’re a Muslim, let me ask you something."

[00:03-00:07]
Visual: Slight zoom-in, calm face, brows slightly furrowed.
Voiceover: "If Allah is all-knowing and He decides everything… are we really responsible for the sins we commit?"

[00:07-00:15]
Visual: Person sighs and looks down thoughtfully. Cut to screen recording of scrolling Islamic Q&A forums and TikTok clips.
Voiceover: "Let’s be honest, every Muslim has had this question in their mind, but no one really has a clear answer."

[00:15-00:25]
Visual: The person looks into the camera with a small smile, then gestures toward phone screen.
Voiceover: "I was trembling with the same thought — it was seriously bothering me. And then I found this app called Hikma AI."

[00:25-00:35]
Visual: Screen recording of the Hikma AI app interface. User typing the same question in the chat: “If Allah decides everything, am I still responsible?” Smooth scroll through the AI’s Quran and Hadith-based explanation.
Voiceover: "I can ask any question, no matter how deep or confusing, and it gives straight, Quran and Hadith-based answers — no fluff, just truth."

[00:35-00:45]
Visual: Cut to the user reading the app’s response, visibly relieved. Overlay: “Finally understood.” Subtle spiritual background music starts.
Voiceover: "The answers felt personal, clear, and directly from authentic sources. It honestly lifted a huge weight off me."

[00:45-00:55]
Visual: Split screen — before (confused, stressed) / after (calm, peaceful).
Voiceover: "Now, instead of doubt, I feel clarity. Instead of confusion, peace."

[00:55-01:00]
Visual: Calm smile, phone held up showing the Hikma AI logo. Text overlay: “Ask anything. Find your answers.” Call-to-action button animation: “Download Hikma AI.”
Voiceover: "If you’ve got questions too, download Hikma AI and find your peace today."
